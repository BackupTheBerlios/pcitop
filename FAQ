                                =============

This is the pcitop FAQ.  Any suggestions/corrections/etc should be
directed to andrew.patterson@hp.com.  The FAQ answers the following
questions:

    1) What platforms is pcitop supported on?


  1) Pcitop is currently only supported on Linux on HP Itanium (IA-64)
     platforms running a kernel version of 2.6.16 or later. We hope to add
     more platforms later as vendors release the needed root bridge interface
     specifications.
