This project uses both a user tool, pcitop, and a driver, hplba.  Both
must be built. The driver must be built for the exact kernel you are
running on.  The driver must be loaded before running pcitop along
with one of either acpiphp or the pci_slot drivers. Pcimon will issue
an error message if the appropriate drivers are not loaded.

1. Make sure you have kernel source available for your kernel. A link
to this source is assumed to be in "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build".

2. Unpack the source

3. Run make

   $ make

4. Run make install as root

   # make install

5. Load the hplba driver.

   # insmod drivers/hplba.ko

6. Run the tool as root.

   # pcitop -i # displays info about the PCI buses on the system.
   # pcitop    # displays bus utilization
